    <h2>A Fast Yummy and Easy Breakfast</h2>

    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>

    <ul> <li>3 large eggs</li>
    <li>Large pinch fine sea salt, to taste</li>
    <li>Freshly ground black pepper, to taste</li>
    <li>1 to 2 teaspoons minced fresh herbs, such as parsley, tarragon, chives or a combination (optional)</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon unsalted butter</li> </ul>


    <h3>Steps:</h3>
    <ul>
    <li>Crack eggs into a medium bowl. Add 1 tablespoon water, and salt and pepper. Whisk with a fork until egg whites are incorporated 
        into yolks. Mix in herbs, if using.</li>
    <li>Place a 8- to 9-inch skillet (preferably nonstick or seasoned carbon steel) over high heat. Melt butter until bubbling subsides.
    <li>Pour in egg mixture and reduce heat to medium. With the back of a fork or a heatproof rubber spatula, whisk eggs around skillet 
        until the bottom begins to set. This takes only a few seconds. Add any fillings, if using.</li>
    <li>Tilt skillet and either bang or flip egg over itself. Use fork or spatula if necessary to complete folding in half or thirds. </li>
        Angle the skillet and a serving plate together, and flip omelet onto plate.</li>

        </ul>
